# bootstrap-change-tooltip

This code specifically changes a button's tooltip text based on an *if* statement. The intention is to have the user click on a button, which then checks or calculates whatever you need it to, and then displays a result in a tooltip. Useful if you don't know what your tooltip needs to say before the user clicks it.

To run this code properly, you will need to download [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and put these files in the Bootstrap folder.

If you prefer to run it without Bootstrap, comment out line 4 of *bs-change-tooltip.js* and the script should run fine. Watch the HTML code for the button in the console or add *console.log*s to the *if* statement to see the result.
